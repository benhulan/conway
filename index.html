        <h4>The rules of the game of life:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.</li>
            <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
            <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
            <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this visualization, live cells will be displayed in yellow. The number in a cell references the number of live neighbors a cell has.</p>
